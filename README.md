# Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm **yiatzz** and mainly a Java Developer!<br>
Currently, I'm specialized in creating scalable Backend systems and have skills in other areas ğŸ˜„

My main goal is to create systems that are simple but scalable at the same time, allowing easy maintenance and future upgrades.<br>
ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Free-Lancer developing minecraft plugins<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I've started programming with 15 years old trying to create my own Minecraft server!
